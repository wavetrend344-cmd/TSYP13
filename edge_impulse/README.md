# 🚀 Edge Impulse Model Integration + STM32 Deployment

This repository contains all code and resources used to create, train, and deploy the **ADCS Telemetry Anomaly Detection Model** using **Edge Impulse** and run it on the **STM32F429** board.

### Folder Details

| Folder / File | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|
| **data_acquisition** | Used to collect and upload raw satellite ADCS telemetry to Edge Impulse Studio using the CLI / data uploader. |
| **processing_block** | Defines the signal preprocessing & feature extraction methods used in the Edge Impulse pipeline. |
| **learning_block** | Contains the architecture customization for the neural network classifier running on the satellite. |
| **satellite_telemetry_anomaly_dete.1.0.3.pack** | **Deployment package generated by Edge Impulse** — imported into STM32CubeMX / CubeIDE to run the model on the STM32 board. |

## 🧠 How the Model Was Built

1. Raw ADCS telemetry was collected and uploaded using the **data_acquisition** scripts.
2. Signal processing & feature extraction steps were defined inside **processing_block**.
3. A lightweight ML classifier was configured in **learning_block**, optimized for on-board inference.
4. The final model was generated and exported as:

satellite_telemetry_anomaly_dete.1.0.3.pack

which is directly compatible with **STM32CubeMX + STM32Cube.AI**.

## 🔧 Deploying the Model to STM32

To use the `.pack` file with STM32CubeIDE, follow the official Edge Impulse guide:

**Documentation:**  
https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/hardware/deployments/run-cubemx

This guide explains:
- Importing the `.pack` file into CubeMX
- Generating inference C code
- Compiling firmware for STM32
- Running inference on-board

## 🛰 Viewing Inference Output (STM32F429)

Once deployed, run the firmware and open a serial monitor to observe anomaly detection output.

See detailed instructions here:

STM32f429/README.md


This includes:
- Build steps
- Debug mode setup
- Serial monitoring via PuTTY
- How to modify input telemetry arrays
